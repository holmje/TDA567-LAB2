Tokeneer Report

Our system is divided in to the following classes described below. And work as follows:
The EnrollmentStn creates a Token based on fingerprint and clearance level. The Idstn is a 
Identification station where the Token is used to grant access or deny access to a door.
We did not create a user that holds the Token. We just created the system. A User would
have been a single class just holding the Token.



class Token:
This class is the identification Token. A Token is made out of a fingerprint(uniqe), 
clearance level(1,2,3 - Low, Medium and High),and a validation tag (valid).

class Idstn:
This class can be considered as the unit thats mounted att the door. It takes the Token
and the fingerprint as input. The idstn has a securitylvl and alarm. If the Token
has a to low clearance level a alarm will be alerted and the Token vill be invalidated.
And the door wont open. But uf the Token has the correct clearance level the door will open.
The correct the clearance level must be >= securitylvl.

class EnrollmentStn:
This class keeps track of all the fingerprints that is paired with the Token. It creates
a Token based on a fingerprint and a clearance level. The fingerprint is being stored in a 
set<int>. The fingerprint is uniqe and the program makes it impossible to create two
equivalent Tokens.

class Test:
This class has one method test_All(). It tests the following:
- Creation stations.
- Enrollment of Tokens works
- Makes sure that the fingerprints are added to the set<int> users
- Makes sure that a each Token with different access levels
	can open their door with security level equivalent
- Test to grant access to a Idstn with both to low clearance level and to high clearance level
    - When too low clearance level the alarm should go off and the token should become invalid
    - When the Tokens clearance level is >= security level access should be granted.
